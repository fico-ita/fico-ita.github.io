On 08 Mar 2023, we had a meeting about Quant's international career with Thársis Souza, Senior Vice President at [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/) in New York, an investment fund quantitative with US$ 60 Billion in assets under management.

The meeting was part of the first class of the subject [PO-245: Machine Learning in Quantitative Finance](https://lnkd.in/ebj3biXi) at [Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica - ITA](http://www.ita .br/).

The subject is organized by FICO - ITA professors, with the objective of preparing their students to work as Quant in the global investment fund industry.

Many thanks to Tharsis and good studies for our students throughout the module.
