The development of strategies for systematic investments is one of the most exciting areas of Computational Finance. This involves creating sophisticated algorithms that are capable of analyzing vast amounts of financial data and making automated investment decisions.

One of the main advantages of systematic investments is the ability to make consistent, data-driven investment decisions, eliminating the influence of human emotions and personal biases. This leads to more objective decision-making and a reduction in judgment errors.

However, developing systematic investment strategies can be extremely challenging. This requires a deep understanding of financial theory, as well as advanced computing and mathematics. However, the advantages of systematic investments, such as consistent, data-driven decision making, can be extremely attractive to investors looking to maximize their returns and minimize their risks.

At FICO-ITA, we research methods to identify patterns in financial data and to use sophisticated algorithms that are able to take advantage of these patterns. To learn more about our research, contact us.
